[OpenPlans](http://openplans.org) developed a prototype reference [GeoReport v2](/GeoReport_v2 "wikilink") client for the iPhone.

The idea is to support all major features of the v2 API well enough to be useful in cities that implement the v2 API, and give implementers something fun to test with.

*It is not under active development* as of Feb 2012. We recommend looking at [1](http://wiki.open311.org/Main_Page#Open_Source_Clients)[other open-source GeoReport clients.]

Source code is here: <http://github.com/openplans/GeoReport-iPhone> It is a fork of the open-source [Ushahidi](http://ushahidi.org)[iPhone app](http://github.com/ushahidi/Ushahidi_iPhone).

Issue tracking is here: <http://developer.open311.org>

Work to be done can be seen in this list of tickets: <http://developer.open311.org/report/9>
