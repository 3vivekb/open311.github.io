Also use varitey of work ticket systems mantained by different agencies, put all into Oracle bi system, that maintains tracking of requests. Used for broader transparency prograsm, CitiStat, some 311 data also available in difficult to consume formats, but working to change that. Website, 311 online. Also working to push people out of the phone channel, easier to manage, more cost-effective. That site has been available since June. Trying to expand capability to accept more types of request. Trying to expand into web 2.0 tech, eg twitter, facebook, but not yet really leveraging. Also have a contest going called Big Apps which started a few weeks ago. Currently has 172 datasets as part of that contest, but no API. Also has an Iphone app. Submit via email? Would like to change that, standard API. Lot of focus has been used for SR, but 311 also used to disseminate information. NYC would like to talk more about, how an API level system can help disseminate information, even though that's more loosely structured. Architecture and workflow lifecycle of SR sytem? Someone will call, be in Siebel system, then at agency level, different types of connections. Agencies that directly access Siebel ... Has business intelligence connection and data warehouse that has data from lots of agencies, agencies can manage from own sytem. They pull into bi system and put on their website, allows caller to have acces to call status
